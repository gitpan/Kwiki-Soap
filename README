Kwiki::SOAP provides a system for interacting with SOAP services
on the web through WAFL phrases. Kwiki::SOAP is a base class
for other classes which implement the handling of WSDL files,
selecting methods, and formatting output. Kwiki::SOAP::Fortune
is provided as an example. Kwiki::SOAP::Google is available
as a separate module distribution.

There's a great deal here to improve and refactor, but it
demonstrates the point: A SOAP walf phrase plugin acting
as a base class for various uses of SOAP APIs.
